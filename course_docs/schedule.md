Below you will find a description for each day of the semester.  

Note: For the first few days (probably into the second week) of the semester, we will be having a review/summary of the main concepts in Quantum Mechanics.  I will provide some suggestions for reading for these days, but you are encouraged to look at the topic and search out your own reading material on that topic.  Quantum Mechanics is not that challenging.  Don't let the name psyche you out... you can do this.
  
## Day 1 (Monday September 16)
   - Topic:  After the course overview/introductions we will have a short discussion on the history of quantum mechanics, what a wave-function is, it's stastical interpretation, and how to normalize it.

   - Suggested Reading: Griffiths [1.1 - 1.4][griffiths_chp_1]
   - Additinonal/Alternative suggestion for reading: Liboff pg 55 - 56 (If you have already taken Quantum, you should have the Liboff text)
   - Also:  Use Google.  There is plenty of reading out there on this topic.

   - Homework: [Here][day1]

## Day 2 (Wednesday September 18)

   - Topic:  The main pillars of quantum mechanics will be set forth.  Where appropriate, we will do example/homework problems together to help illustrate.
   - Reading: Griffiths [1.5,1.6][griffiths_chp_1] and [2.1,2.2][griffiths_chp_2]
   - Alternative/Supplemental reading: Liboff ch 3.1 - 3.4

   - Description: Postulates of QM.  i) Operators as observables.  ii) Measurement changes state of particle.  iii) Expectation values iv) time evolution of state function.  

   - Homework [here][day2]

   - Instructor notes:  We'll briefly discuss each postulate and give examples.  For examples, when we talk about operators as observables, let's talk about momentum eigenstates.  Since momentum eigenstates are not normalizable (and therefore unphysical) they can't represent a real physical situation.  Instead, to make it normalizable, we must add many momentum eigenstates together to form a wave packet.  This will naturally lead to the concepts of group and phase velocity, and uncertainty relationships.  Continuing on, we'll solve Schrodinger's equation for an infinte square well (easy), and then explore the other postulates on this situation.   Consider a particle's state (not an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian) and start asking questions like, "What is the probability that measurement of energy leads to E_i, or we can do the same with momentum.

## Day 3 (Friday September 20)

   - Reading: Griffiths  2.1 - 2.3
   - Alternative/Supplemental reading: Krane 4.5

   - Description: Hilbert Space, dirac notation, orthonormal sets.

   - Class Time:  Discussion with scratch-off questions.  We will start our first numerical solution to Schrodinger's equation today.  Don't spend too much time on all the details given in section 2.3.  We will solve this one numerically.

## Day 4 (Monday September 23)

   - Reading: Griffiths  3.1 - 3.4
   - Alternative/Supplemental reading: Sutton 2.1 ("Reviews of bras, kets, and all that.")

   - Description: Hydrogen Atom, Overview of analytical treatment,  Computational solution using plane-wave basis

   - Class Time:  Discussion with scratch-off questions.  We will start our first numerical solution to Schrodinger's equation today.  Don't spend too much time on all the details given in section 2.3.  We will solve this one numerically.


## Day 5 (Wednesday September 25)

   - Reading: Krane 7.3 (Review of Hydrogen Atom) and Sutton 2.1 ("A homonuclear diatomic molecule: the hydrogen molecule.")

   - Description: Diatomic molecule.  Discuss the analytical treatment from Sutton.  Solve computationally using plane wave basis.

   - Class Time:  We will have some discussion about the math used in this section and then we will work on a numerical solution to this problem.

## Day 6 (Wednesday September 25)

   - Reading: Krane 7.3 (Review of Hydrogen Atom) and Sutton 2.1 ("A homonuclear diatomic molecule: the hydrogen molecule.")

   - Description: Time-development of hydrogen molecule.  Analytical treatment.

   - Class Time:  We will have some discussion about the math used in this section and then we will work on a numerical solution to this problem.
