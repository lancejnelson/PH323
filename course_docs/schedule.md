Below you will find a description for each day of the semester.  

## Day 1 (Monday September 16)

   - Reading: Griffiths 1.1 - 1.3
   - Alternative/Supplemental reading: Krane section 5.3 

   - Description: We will learn the basics of quantum mechanics. Schrodinger's equation. wavefunctions,  discrete and continuous probabilities.

   - Class Time:  Discussion with scratch-off questions.  May need Mathematica or Python.


## Day 2 (Wednesday September 18)

   - Reading: Griffiths  1.4 - 1.6
   - Alternative/Supplemental reading: Krane 4.5

   - Description: Normalization of the wavefunction, operators and expectation values, uncertainty principle, wave packets.

   - Class Time:  Discussion with scratch-off questions.  May need Mathematica or Python.

## Day 3 (Friday September 20)

   - Reading: Griffiths  2.1 - 2.3
   - Alternative/Supplemental reading: Krane 4.5

   - Description: Stationary States, Infinite well potential, harmonic oscillator.

   - Class Time:  Discussion with scratch-off questions.  We will start our first numerical solution to Schrodinger's equation today.  Don't spend too much time on all the details given in section 2.3.  We will solve this one numerically.

## Day 4 (Monday September 23)

   - Reading: Griffiths  3.1 - 3.4
   - Alternative/Supplemental reading: Sutton 2.1 (Reviews of Bras, Kets, and all that.)

   - Description: Dirac Notation

   - Class Time:  Discussion with scratch-off questions.  We will start our first numerical solution to Schrodinger's equation today.  Don't spend too much time on all the details given in section 2.3.  We will solve this one numerically.
