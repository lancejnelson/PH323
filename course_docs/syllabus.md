## Course Introduction

This course covers the basics of solid state theory, or matter in it's
solid form.  Since some students have not yet completed an
introductory course in quantum mechaninc, and seeing that this topic
is foundational to our topic, we will spend some time at the beginning
of the semester covering the basics of quantum mechanics.  Th

## Course Materials

The required textbook for this class is:
***Solid State Physics for Advanced Undergraduates, 4<sup>th</sup> ed., by Harold T. Stokes***  
We will also use exerpts from the following books:
- ***Electronic Structure of Materials,  by Adrian P. Sutton***  
- ***Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed., by David J. Griffiths***  
- ***Modern Physics, 3<sup>rd</sup> ed., by Kenneth Krane***  

If you'd like to purchase these books, they are good to have.  If not,
our license allows us to provide a PDF of a small portion of these
books.  I will make these exerpts available to you via the course
website.

We will also make extensive use of the python programming language and
Mathematica software.  Both are available freely to BYU-Idaho students
under our site license.

## Course Outcomes

The diligent student should gain the following skills/understanding in the area of solid state physics:

1. have a strong conceptual understanding of a solid's electronic
structure, meaning the nature of the electronic states that result
from a periodic potential.  This topic is a main focus of the class
and is foundational to other topics that will be studied later in the
semester. Therefore, a good portion of the semester will be spent on this topics. 

2. be able to solve quantum mechanical problems numerically using Python.

3. have a strong conceptual understanding of atomic vibrations (aka
phonons) in solids.  This is also a foundational topic that will be
needed for discussions/topics later on in the semester.
  
4. be able to describe the physical arrangement of atoms in a solid
(crystal structure) using terms such as lattice, unit cell,
Wigner-Sitz, symmetry operators, etc.

5. understand the difference between metals, insulators, and
semiconductors.  Along with this comes a more complete understanding
of electrical conductivity in solids.

6. demonstrate a strong understanding of semiconductor devices and how they work.

7. explain the factors that affect heat transport/capacity in solids.


## Prerequisites

Math 316 (differential equations and linear algebra) and PH279 (Modern
Phyics) are pre-requisite to taking this class.  

## Schedule
In accordance with the BYU-Idaho learning model, the schedule for this
class has been designed to give the student opportunities to prepare
to learn, teach other students, and ponder on previously-covered
material. This class is scheduled to meet every day. However we will
only cover new material every other day (lecture days). On lecture
days you should come prepared to take a warm-up quiz and participate
in a discussion. Prepared means that you have studied the reading
material thoroughly and are prepared to teach the concepts that you
understand and ask clearly-articulated questions regarding the
concepts that you don't. Our discussions on lecture days will be
carefully crafted to give you ample opportunity to ask questions and
teach fellow classmates.  On the days in between lecture days you will
be split up into groups and each group will be given a homework
problem to work on at the board. Each group will work together on
their assigned problem and prepare to teach the rest of the class
about their problem. I will be there the entire time to guide your
work and discussion. Your attendance on these days will be crucial to
your learning experience.  The pattern of reading before class
(preparing to learn), participating in class discussions (teach one
another), and group problem solving(ponder and prove) is the
foundation of the learning model and has shown to provide the
appropriate learning pace.

## Grades

If you hit these grade boundaries, you are guaranteed to get the grade
shown.  I may make the grading scale more generous than what is shown,
if it seems appropriate, but I will not make it less generous

|   Standard BYU-Idaho Grading Scale |
|--------------------------------------|
|94-100%  &nbsp; A  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   90 - 93.9% A- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 87 - 89.9% B+|
|83-86.9% &nbsp; B  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   80 - 82.9% B- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77 - 79.9% C+|
|73-76.9% &nbsp; C  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   70 - 72.9% C- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 67 - 69.9% D+|
|63-66.9% &nbsp; D  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   90 - 93.9% D- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Below 60% F|

Your grades will be determined according to the following weights:

### Preparation and Participation - 30% 

Classroom discussions will be crafted to i) explore the concepts from
your reading assignments and/or ii) work on numerical problems that
will assist in your understanding of key concepts. Regardless of how
class time is spent, your level of participation on these days will
count towards your grade.  Your grade for this category will be
assigned using the IFAT scratch-off system. (they're a lot of fun). A
question will be asked and you will be given time to discuss the
answer in groups.  You will then scratch off the chosen answer to see
if you got it right.  Each incorrect scratch will receive a $1/4$
point deduction. As in other classes, the material in this class
builds on itself.  It is therefore very important that you are present
in class and ready to actively participate.


### Homework Assignments  - 30%

Homework assignments will be given on a weekly basis.  These problems
may be analytical or numerical depending on the topic we are studying.
These assignments are due at the beginning of class on the day
indicated on the schedule.



### Exams - 30%

Three midterm exams will be given, with due dates given on the course schedule.

### Final Exam - 10%

The final exam for this courese will be given on the
university-appointed time at the end of the semester.  I may choose to
make this a take-home exam.

## Late Work

All assignments are due at the beginning of class on the date marked
on the schedule. If the due date changes I will notify you in class
and via email. To allow for emergencies or adding the class late, you
will get two free late assignments; after that, late work only counts
for half credit. Late work will only be accepted for two weeks after
the original due date. No homework assignments will be dropped. When
turning in late homework please put the word “Late” at the top.


## Extra Credit


Often students ask for opportunities for extra credit. Here is your
chance. This opportunity is designed to help you become comfortable
using a computer in a scientific setting and you'll be asked to put
away your calculator and use Python to perform all
calculations. Python is a computer programming language very popular
among scientists and engineers and this extra credit opportunity is
designed to give you experience using it.  Here is the offer: For
every HW assignment in which you only use python for calculations, I
will award you 1/2% points on the final exam.

## Teaching Philosophy

I love studying physics because I feel
## University Policies

### Honor Code

The Honor code is a great blessing to all of us here at BYU-Idaho. It
invites the Holy Ghost into the learning environment, which greatly
enhances the learning experience. I encourage you to embrace this code
of conduct and strive to fully live by its standards. I promise that
you will receive rich blessings, both spiritual and temporal, as a
result of your obedience in this area.  Among other things, living by
the honor code involves:

- Behaving professionally: I expect professional behavior in the classroom. If I see unprofessional behavior I will point it out to you so that you can start to learn what will be expected of you in a professional environment.  You can find BYU-Idaho's standard on classroom etiquette here: [Classroom Etiquette][etiquette]

- Being honest: Plagiarism is a violation of the honor code and will merit a failing grade in the class. Plagiarism means using someone else's work and pass it off as your own and will not be tolerated. This is a principle that transcends college and I would not be a good mentor to you if I did not teach it to you now. Do not use other's work and turn it in to me as if it were your own. You can find BYU-Idaho's standard on academic honesty here: [Academic Honesty][honesty]

- Dress and Grooming: I expect you to fully abide by the University's dress and grooming standards. If I notice that you are not in compliance, I will mention it to you. You can find BYU-Idaho's dress and grooming standards here: [Dress and Grooming][dress]
