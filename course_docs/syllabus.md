## Course Introduction

This course covers the basics of solid state theory, or matter in it's
solid form.  Briefly stated, we will study electronic structure,
phonons, crystal structures and symmetry, metals, insulator,
semiconductors, heat transfer/capacity, electrical conductivity, and
x-ray diffraction.  Additionally, since quantum mechanics is an
essential foundation for us, we will spend some time at the beginning
of the semester covering the basics of this topic.  This will mostly
serve as a review.

## Course Materials

The required textbooks for this class are:

***Solid State Physics for Advanced Undergraduates, 4<sup>th</sup> ed., by Harold T. Stokes*** (only available in bookstore)   
and   
[***Electronic Structure of Materials,  by Adrian P. Sutton***][suttonbook]
  
You are encouraged to purchase both of these books.  If the cost
presents a challenge, please purchase the Sutton book and I will
provide a PDF of the portion of the Stokes book that we will use.

I will also provide excerpts from the following book:
- ***Introduction to Quantum Mechanics, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed., by David J. Griffiths***  


We will also make extensive use of the python programming language and
Mathematica software.  Both are available freely to BYU-Idaho students
under our site license.

## Course Outcomes

The diligent student should gain the following skills/understanding in
the area of solid state physics:

1. have a strong conceptual understanding of a solid's electronic
structure, meaning the nature of the electronic states that result
from a periodic potential.  This topic is a main focus of the class
and is foundational to other topics that will be studied later in the
semester. Therefore, a good portion of the semester will be spent on
this topics.  Fermi Surface, Bloch functions, density of states,
Brillioun zone, Band Structure, and Fermi-Dirac distribution function are key ideas.

2. be able to solve quantum mechanical and classical eigenvalue
problems numerically using Python and/or Mathematica.  This task will be
done repeatedly as we start with an atom, then a diatomic molecule,
and eventually a chain of atoms.  It is the hope of the instructor
that this approach will help uncover the key physics associated with a
periodic array of atoms.

3. have a strong conceptual understanding of atomic vibrations (aka
phonons) in solids.  This will be done analytically as well as
numerically. This is also a foundational topic that will be needed for
discussions/topics later on in the semester. 
  
4. be able to use industry(field) standards for describing the physical
 location of the atoms in a solid.  This requires the competent use of
 the following terms: lattice, conventional unit cell, Wigner-Sitz
 unit cell, basis vectors, lattice vectors, symmetry operators, etc.

5. understand the difference between metals, insulators, and
semiconductors.  Along with this comes a more complete understanding
of electrical conductivity in solids and why some materials conduct
electricity better than others. Effective mass, holes, doping, and the
Hall effect are key ideas.

6. demonstrate a strong understanding of semiconductor devices and how
they work. Key ideas include, p-n junctions, depletion layer,
transisitor, diode, Lasers, etc.

7. explain the factors that affect heat transport/capacity in
solids. Key Ideas include density of modes, and debye model.

8. Understand x-ray diffraction and how it can be used to determine a
solid's crystal structure.



## Prerequisites

Math 316 (differential equations and linear algebra) and PH279 (Modern
Phyics) are pre-requisite to taking this class.  

## Schedule 

Lower-level physics courses benefit from easy access to vast libraries
of practice (homework) problems.  Such is not the case in this course.
Often, there is only one or two problems on a given topic and
sometimes those problems are very challenging.  Hence, the standard
model for a physics class (class time = concept discussion,
out-of-class = homework time for practice) doesn't always work as well
here.  When I can employ the standard model, I will.  Other times I
will choose a well-designed, yet challenging problem and use class
time to work through it with you, stopping periodically to let you
struggle a little.  This ensures that we all achieve the desired
result together and **can discuss the key takeaways as a group**.
Often, these problems will require the use of a computer (Mathematica
or Python) so make sure you bring your laptop with you.  I will find a
way to incorporate our daily scratch-off quiz on these days.

## Grades

If you hit these grade boundaries, you are guaranteed to get the grade
shown.  I may make the grading scale more generous than what is shown,
if it seems appropriate, but I will not make it less generous

|   Standard BYU-Idaho Grading Scale |
|--------------------------------------|
|94-100%  &nbsp; A  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   90 - 93.9% A- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 87 - 89.9% B+|
|83-86.9% &nbsp; B  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   80 - 82.9% B- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;77 - 79.9% C+|
|73-76.9% &nbsp; C  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   70 - 72.9% C- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 67 - 69.9% D+|
|63-66.9% &nbsp; D  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   90 - 93.9% D- &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Below 60% F|

Your grades will be determined according to the following weights:

### Preparation and Participation - 30% 

Classroom discussions will be crafted to i) explore the concepts from
your reading assignments and/or ii) work on numerical problems that
will assist in your understanding of key concepts. Regardless of how
class time is spent, your level of participation on these days will
count towards your grade.  Your grade for this category will be
assigned using the IFAT scratch-off system. (they're a lot of fun). A
question will be asked and you will be given time to discuss the
answer in groups.  You will then scratch off the chosen answer to see
if you got it right.  Each incorrect scratch will receive a $1/4$
point deduction. As in other classes, the material in this class
builds on itself.  It is therefore very important that you are present
in class and ready to actively participate.


### Homework Assignments  - 30%

Homework assignments will be given on a weekly basis.  These problems
may be analytical or numerical depending on the topic we are studying.
These assignments are due at the beginning of class on the day
indicated on the schedule.



### Exams - 30%

Three midterm exams will be given, with due dates given on the course schedule.

### Final Exam - 10%

The final exam for this courese will be given on the
university-appointed time at the end of the semester.  I may choose to
make this a take-home exam.

## Late Work

All assignments are due at the beginning of class on the date marked
on the schedule. If the due date changes I will notify you in class
and via email. To allow for emergencies or adding the class late, you
will get two free late assignments; after that, late work only counts
for half credit. Late work will only be accepted for two weeks after
the original due date. No homework assignments will be dropped. When
turning in late homework please put the word “Late” at the top.


## Extra Credit

For those planning to attend graduate school, being able to read a
publication in your field is super important.  When you first start
this it can be challenging, bu the more exposure you get to your
sub-field the easier it becomes.  Below you will find a list of
publications in my subfield of physics.  To earn this extra credit,
you should pick one of them and commit to reading and understanding
the entire thing.  To prove to me that you have, periodically you
should come to me and show me your highlighting and ask any questions
that you may have.  (If you claim to not have had any questions, I
won't believe that you read the article thoroughly.)  

## Teaching
Philosophy

For me, studying physics is a quest to uncover pure truth

## University Policies

### Honor Code

The Honor code is a great blessing to all of us here at BYU-Idaho. It
invites the Holy Ghost into the learning environment, which greatly
enhances the learning experience. I encourage you to embrace this code
of conduct and strive to fully live by its standards. I promise that
you will receive rich blessings, both spiritual and temporal, as a
result of your obedience in this area.  Among other things, living by
the honor code involves:

- Behaving professionally: I expect professional behavior in the classroom. If I see unprofessional behavior I will point it out to you so that you can start to learn what will be expected of you in a professional environment.  You can find BYU-Idaho's standard on classroom etiquette here: [Classroom Etiquette][etiquette]

- Being honest: Plagiarism is a violation of the honor code and will merit a failing grade in the class. Plagiarism means using someone else's work and pass it off as your own and will not be tolerated. This is a principle that transcends college and I would not be a good mentor to you if I did not teach it to you now. Do not use other's work and turn it in to me as if it were your own. You can find BYU-Idaho's standard on academic honesty here: [Academic Honesty][honesty]

- Dress and Grooming: I expect you to fully abide by the University's dress and grooming standards. If I notice that you are not in compliance, I will mention it to you. You can find BYU-Idaho's dress and grooming standards here: [Dress and Grooming][dress]
